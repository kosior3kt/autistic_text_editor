## What?
Just a text editor. It is crossplatform (as long as you a have raylib installed).

## Why?
Idk, I was bored

## Installation
git clone this bad boy and then insepct my build script and craft something similar.
It's not too bad. It uses has 2 files, one of which is redundant, so yeah, you should
be fine with just 
``` C
gcc main.c -I<path/to/raylib> -o dupa
```
